# ELSA training data generation

This package provides a simple setup for data generation by spawning objects of different shapes and sizes. This was used to train an object classification SVM as in [*Uyanik et. al (2013)*][uyanik-paper]. The trained SVM was able to determine the correct class (Sphere, Cylinder, Box) in over 95% of the time.
